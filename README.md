# Currencies_chart
This Streamlit-based dashboard is designed to provide an interactive and real-time overview of currency exchange rates, focusing on how different major currencies perform against the Hungarian Forint (HUF). By integrating live exchange rate data from the Open Exchange Rates API, the application continuously fetches and updates values for selected currencies such as the US Dollar (USD), Euro (EUR), British Pound (GBP), Australian Dollar (AUD), and Polish Zloty (PLN). The architecture of the app is structured around two main components: a data source that handles API requests and transformations, and a chart creator that visualizes the results with Plotly.

The dashboard offers users a simple yet powerful interface. At the core is an interactive line chart, where each currency’s performance is displayed over time. The chart highlights fluctuations in exchange rates by plotting HUF per unit of each foreign currency, enabling quick insights into short-term trends as well as broader patterns. Distinct colors are assigned to each currency for clarity, and the visualization is dynamically updated as new data arrives. To enhance readability, the chart is configured with fixed axis ranges and styled with a modern dark theme.

Beyond visualization, the app also delivers important summary metrics. A small metrics panel displays the number of currencies being tracked and the exact timestamp of the most recent update. These indicators are useful for both monitoring accuracy and ensuring that the displayed data is fresh. Users can control the behavior of the app through a sidebar, where options are available to enable or disable automatic data refresh and adjust the refresh interval between updates (from 5 to 50 seconds). This flexibility allows users to tailor the dashboard to their specific monitoring needs, whether they prefer frequent updates for high activity or slower refreshes to reduce noise.

For transparency and further analysis, the application also provides access to the raw data. Through an expandable section, users can view the historical table of exchange rates collected during the session, including currency names, prices, and timestamps. This combination of raw data access and visual insights makes the tool not only informative but also versatile for both quick checks and deeper exploration.

Overall, this dashboard serves as a practical and user-friendly solution for anyone interested in following currency exchange dynamics against the HUF in real time. It combines automation, clean visualization, and interactivity into a compact tool that can be run locally or deployed for broader use. By leveraging Python’s data handling capabilities, Plotly’s visualization power, and Streamlit’s simplicity, the app transforms complex financial data into clear, actionable insights.
